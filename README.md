- Caesar Encryption - It's a simple interpreter for what I call Caesar Encryption. I don't know if that's the correct terminology but I use it.

# How-to
Just download the files you want to use and you should be good to go to start editing them. 
If you'd like to have something made especially for you or a more in-depth guide of how everything works, hit me up. 
We can surely make things fit together nicely. 

# Notice
For some of the sites I will have available you might need to have a web-server to run, because I am going to use PHP. 
In some cases you might need access to a MySQL-server, too. I'm going to have some account-systems and prototype shops
with shopping-carts and such.
